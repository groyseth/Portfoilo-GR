To start I made an HTML file and Assets folder that contains my css folder and imgs file.
I placed a rest.css in my css folder and liked it to html
I made a wireframe for all my boxes, header, and the main body.
Once I had all my boxs in place I worked on the header, finding colors and images that looked good
with the page.
In the header is a sidebar with the links and profile picture with a discription.
I worked down and placed a sidebar with text inside, then I put 3 flexboxes next to the sidebar.
I fit the 3 images in each flexbox for 3 coming soon projects along with 3 "Coming Soon" text.
Then I got the links in the header liked to the desonations in the main.
I filled out the about me and footer that have links with my contact information.
Next I made some media quarries for a max width of 415px, 768px and 1177px.
I went back and added an overlay to the header main picture with the text "Welcome!" once hovered over.
