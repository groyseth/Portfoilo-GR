 # My Password Genorator #
I read the javascript and wrote my phsudo code.
I started to write code inside the generatepassword function.
I made an empty array with capital letters, lowercase letters, special characters and numbers.
Then I made 2 empty arrays, one to fill and the other to stay empty till I got to making the loop and randomizer.
I continued to make 1 prompt and 4 confirm boxes.
Inside the prompt you are only allowed to have a 8 digit password to a 128 digit password, in any less or more you will be returned.
The amount typed into the prompt is then saved to the variable passwordLength the keep track.
Inside each confirm box if you select yes or cancel, the input is saved to the userPic array.
If you press cancel the password won't include the type of character.
I made a for loop with "passwordLength" and connected to it a number randomizer with all of the users input "userPic" and 
connected it to the empty array "collect".
Once I tested that collect was working in the dev tool, I joined it to "passwordText".
Now when you click generate password and enter the prompt and confirms, you have a generated password with the correct crytieria.
